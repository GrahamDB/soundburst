### Deployment Select

Click the "Folder Select" button that now appears under the "Select a Deployment" dropdown.
Similar to the project select, a window will open with the list of deployments within the initial project folder.
Highlight a folder. You will notice that the right pane may say "empty folder", that is a limitation of the package, as it is looking for more folders. There will still be .wav files.

### Deployment Information

The next form that appears will be for deployment-specific meta-data.
Name will be auto-populated by the deployment folder name. This can be changed.
Lat, Lon, and Recorder ID are all REQUIRED fields.
Lat and Lon fields work best if using only numeric values (ie. 77, -44).
Start and End times are populated from the dates within the actual file names.

NOTE: the increment value is to be between 0 - 1. This will represent the percentage at which the files is incremented.
For example, if you enter 0.2, the file will increment 5x (20% for each spectrogram).
Selecting "Do Not Increment" will render the full file in one spectrogram.

Once yous ee that, you can make a clip similar to :https://s3.amazonaws.com/blueraster-users/jglatman/soundburst/clip.png
A clipped spectrogram will appear below, as will a form on the bottom right (https://s3.amazonaws.com/blueraster-users/jglatman/soundburst/annotation.png)
Most of the fields are auto-populated. Please fill in the Type, and Species, and any notes about the clip.
After submitting, the clip in the main spectrogram will turn green, letting you know it is complete. You may then make another clip.
The meta-data created here will populate in a csv within the specific deployment folder.

please click the "Upload to AWS" button at the top.
